**Rambling about computing, programming, audio and more.**

I'm Sobrino Julian, a UX-focused front-end designer, technical writer, and self-taught developer who creates enjoyable experiences for humans. This site is where I ramble about design, programming, hardware, Linux, and OpenBSD.

Passionate about open source software, usability, performance, privacy, and minimal design. This small piece of the internet stores a growing collection of my personal brain dumps.
