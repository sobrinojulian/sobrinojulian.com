**The designer and developer - not the [BPFtrace syntax](https://man.openbsd.org/bt)**

I'm Brad Taunt, a UX-focused front-end designer, technical writer, and self-taught developer who creates enjoyable experiences for humans. This site is where I ramble about design, programming, hardware, Linux, and OpenBSD.

Passionate about open source software, usability, performance, privacy, and minimal design. This small piece of the internet stores a growing collection of my personal [brain dumps](/dump).
