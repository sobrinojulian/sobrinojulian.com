I love [tech](https://jamespanther.com/uses/) and regularly explore [projects](https://jamespanther.com/projects/) where I experiment with various open-source technologies. This website is where I share my [technology experiences](https://jamespanther.com/writings/). I also write about food at [Southside Kitchen](https://southsidekitchen.com).
