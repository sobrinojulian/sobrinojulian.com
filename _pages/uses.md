# Things I Use

This page contains a somewhat up-to-date listing of all hardware and software that I currently use. Seeing similar pages on other people's personal websites have proved quite valuable to me, so I figured I would do the same!

## Services

I'm proud to support open source products and privacy-respecting communities. The list is limited right now, but the plan is to expand this over time. My current, self-imposed FOSS contributing "budget" is **$13 USD**.

|Service|Cost/month|
|-------|--------------|
|[sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org)<br>Open source code forge.|$5.00|
|[mullvad](https://mullvad.net)<br>Privacy focused VPN service provider.|$5.00|
|[fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org)<br>My main "social media" online presence.|$3.00|
